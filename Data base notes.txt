Data Base:

Memory
To store the data in persistent storage device,so that it will remain availablea all time
2 ways to store the data in persistent storage device

	1.Stre it file in fix format file----Flat file.
		a.Always read and write data in sequence ,random access to data is not possible.
		b.To modify data , we ned to read data in memory line by line modify it and write the file or create new file.

	2.Database
		a.Types of Data Bases,
			i.RDBMS-Relatinal Database Management System.
				eg.Oracle,MySQL,PostreSQL,SQL derver.
			ii.NOSQL-to nstructured data.
				eg.ongoDB,CouchbaseDB,Cassandr
			iii.GraphDB- To get the displa in graph Format.
				eg.Neo4J
			iv.MmDB-If we store the data in memory.	
				eg.VoltDB,MEM-DB.

**SQL-Structured Query language.

RDBMS---Features/Significance or key steps:--- :)
	a.Client server architecture
	b.Secure--unless you have username and Password you canno access the data.
	c.Easy to use.
	d.RDBMS application can be used from programs Java,Python,PERL,PHP.
	e.It is scalable.
	f.It supports transaction control.-Most of financila application or where u need security and tracnsaction control then we use RDBMS.
		eg.Transfer Fund--->Money gets withdrawn from source acc before it gets transferred fto destinatio acc then network goes
		or connection time out.
	g.Structured data- When data needs to be in some speified format only then we call this data a structured data.
	h.It avoid redundancy-Duplcacy of data is easy-Managing data is easy.

**NOSQL-NonStructured Quer Language.
	a.Data is stored in unstructured manner--Data can be entered in any format,likepictures or text emoji.
		Usually used in social media.
	b.Less Secure as compared to RDBMS.
	c.It is faser compared to RDBMS.
	d.Scalable.

**GraphDB
	a.Show the data in graph format.
	b.If you want to display it as a network.

**MemDB-
	a.When the size of data is small.
	b.If you need faste access of data.
		Example- in research project.

	MySQL
	
	Drawbacks
	1.MySQL doesnot support intersectio operation,reference cursors,intead of trigger,statement level triggers.
	2.in MSQL very large database are less efficient as compared to oracl. 

	Stucture of Data
	To store the data the way it is organised is called as data model
		Different models-	Hierarchial Model(Obsolete),Network Model(Obsolete),Relational Model.

	Why to use database:
	>Data is stored in centralised server hence can be shared between application.
	>Data stored in structured manner,in relation format so retrival of  data is easy.
